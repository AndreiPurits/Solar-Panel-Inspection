Solar Panel Outlier Detection Using Thermographic Imaging

Overview

This project is part of my Master’s degree in Computer Science at Rostock University. It focuses on detecting outliers (hotspots) on solar panels using thermographic cameras and processing the data with C++ and OpenCV. The program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing thermal images, identifying defects, and visualizing hotspots directly on the images.

Example of the GUI with a detected hotspot

Features

Thermal Image Analysis: Processes thermographic images to detect hotspots and other outliers.

Graphical User Interface: A user-friendly GUI for importing images, analyzing data, and visualizing results.

Custom Thresholding: Adjustable parameters for fine-tuning detection sensitivity.

Data Export: Save analyzed results, including marked hotspots, for further review.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: C++

Libraries: OpenCV, Qt (for GUI)

Tools: Thermographic camera data, IRB file processing

Installation

Prerequisites

A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

CMake (for building the project)

OpenCV (version 4.5 or higher)

Qt (for GUI support)

Build Instructions

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-panel-outlier-detection.git
cd solar-panel-outlier-detection

Create a build directory and navigate to it:

mkdir build && cd build

Run CMake to configure the project:

cmake ..

Build the project:

make

Run the program:

./SolarPanelOutlierDetection

Usage

Load Data: Import thermographic images or IRB files using the GUI.

Analyze: Use the provided sliders and controls to adjust detection thresholds and identify hotspots.

Visualize: Detected hotspots are highlighted on the image.

Export: Save the analyzed image with hotspots to a specified directory.

Example

Include a demonstration of the working program:
